Dataset Flaws

1. Augmentation Overlap:
Augmented versions of the same images appeared in multiple splits, causing data leakage.(Significant issue, but retraining wasn't possible due to time and resource limits.)
Fix: Redefine the splits so all versions of an image remain in a single set.

2. Limited Prompt Variety:
The text prompts are repetitive and lack phrasing diversity.
Fix: Adding varied and contextually different prompts for each class.

3. Bounding Box Labels for Joins:
The join dataset uses bounding boxes instead of proper segmentation masks.
Fix: Convert bounding boxes into approximate line-based masks during preprocessing.

Model Flaws

4. Minimal Tuning:
Hyperparameters were barely optimized due to hardware limitations.

5. Limited Model Exploration:
Only CLIPSeg and YOLO-based approach were tested.
(the earlier plan was to train two YOLO models, one for cracks and one for join. Then use a text embedding of the input prompt to calculate cosine similarity and automatically choose which model to run).



A lot of areas of codes are AI-assisted. I've reviewed and corrected what I could, but there might still be small mistakes or clunky parts hiding around.
